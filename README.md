# ColorfulC
ColorfulC is a C library that allows you to use colors in your console. This has been tested on the default terminals of Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and macOS. (Just something I made cuz I was bored kekw)
# Installation
If you wanna install the library simply download the `colorfulC.h` file and place it in `/usr/include` Ubuntu (Should work on most distros). As for other operating systems, google the directory your C header files are saved in. Place `colorfulC.h` in there and you are done!
# Documentation
Sadly, there is none right now. Though, you can take a good look at the examples to learn it. There isn't much to the library.
# Issues
If there are any problems with the library please open an issue. Pretty sure there will be many because I didnt bother testing it noicely.
